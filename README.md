Detailed Assignment Description
Overview
Develop a console application in C# that simulates caring for a virtual pet. This comprehensive project encompasses fundamental programming concepts like basic program structure, console I/O, data types, type conversion, and control flow elements.

Here is how your final product roughly will look like
 
Detailed Project Features
1.	Pet Creation:
•	Allow the user to choose a pet type (e.g., cat, dog, rabbit) and give it a name.
•	Display a welcome message that includes the pet's type and name.
2.	Pet Care Actions:
•	Implement actions such as:
•	Feeding: Decreases hunger, slightly increases health.
•	Playing: Increases happiness, slightly increases hunger.
•	Resting: Improves health, decreases happiness slightly.
•	Each action should modify the pet's stats accordingly and display a message describing the action's effect.


3.	Pet Status Monitoring:
•	Track and display pet’s stats: hunger, happiness, and health, each on a scale of 1 to 10.
•	Implement a status check that warns the user if any stat is critically low or high.
4.	Time-Based Changes:
•	Simulate the passage of time, where each action represents the passing of an hour.
•	Hunger increases over time, and happiness decreases slightly, prompting regular interaction.
5.	Enhanced Interaction Logic:
•	Implement consequences for neglect, such as health deterioration if the pet is too hungry or unhappy.
•	Include special messages or events based on the pet's status (e.g., the pet refusing to play if too hungry).
6.	User Interface and Experience:
•	Develop a simple, clear, and user-friendly console interface.
•	Include instructions for the user on how to interact with the application.
Development and Submission Guidelines
7.	GitHub Repository:
•	Create a GitHub repository for the project.
•	Regularly commit with descriptive messages.
•	Include a README.md with project description and setup instructions.
8.	Final Submission:
•	Ensure all code is pushed to the GitHub repository before the deadline.
•	Submit the repository link through eConestoga.
•	Screencast video - Upload the video to a platform like YouTube and include the link in your README.md. Check the details of the recording below. You must follow the exact steps below.

Screencast Video Presentation
•	Record a brief video (no longer than 2 minutes)
Application Start (Duration: 30 seconds)
1.	Launch Application:
•	Show the console window as the application starts.
•	Explain that you are choosing a pet type and naming it.


Main Interaction (Duration: 2 minutes)
2.	Navigate Main Menu:
•	Walk through each option in the main menu briefly.
•	Explain what each option does.
3.	Feed the Pet:
•	Choose to feed the pet.
•	Show how the pet's hunger decreases and health increases.
•	Pause to display the updated stats.
4.	Play with the Pet:
•	Select the option to play with the pet.
•	Explain how this action increases happiness but also increases hunger.
•	Show the updated stats again.
5.	Let the Pet Rest:
•	Demonstrate letting the pet rest.
•	Explain the effect on the pet's health and happiness.
•	Display the pet's status post-rest.
6.	Check Pet Status:
•	Use the option to check the pet’s current status.
•	Point out the pet's health, hunger, and happiness levels.
7.	Simulate Passing of Time (if implemented):
•	Describe how time affects the pet's stats.
•	Show the pet's status after simulating a 'time-pass' event.
Conclusion (Duration: 30 seconds)
8.	Exit the Application:
•	Choose to exit the game.
•	Show the application closing.
